## Az-900 4 parts [aka.ms/azfunpath](Azure Path)

+ Explore Microsoft Azure cloud concepts (AZ-900)
+ Distinguish Microsoft Azure Core Services (AZ-900)
+ Examine Microsoft Azure security, privacy, compliance, and trust (AZ-900)
+ Review Microsoft Azure pricing, service level agreements, and lifecycles (AZ-900)

## Explore Microsoft Azure cloud concepts

### ?? missed it

Availability zones ??
Availability Sets

Example Q: Every resource created in Azure must exist in one, and only one, what?

+ Availability Set
+ Availabilty Zone
+ Resource group - missed this talk. I think it's this? check...
+ Azure Resource Manager

### Virtual Machines

/24 = 255.255.255.0 CIDR notation (not this exam)

#### new vm wizard

AutoShutDown - when not being used. Does not include Auto turn back on!

Extensions: add stuff to base vm
eg:

+ install anti-virus
+ Customer Script Extension - now run my custom script as part of the install

'Download a template for automation' - can be used to recreate this vm, minus it's uniqueness (name etc). Is a JSON file.

Bastion service - VM has no public access, only the bastion. Problem was VM public rdp port had to be open to allow remote access = massive security risk.

Virtual Machine Services

+ Azure Vms
+ Vm Sales sets (elastic scale out and in)
+ App services
+ Functions

Containers vs VMs

"Containers don't care what ship they on" - plus much more lightweight. Orchestrator moves the containers from ship to ship = Kubernates (captain in greek).

## Distinguish Microsoft Azure Core Services (AZ-900)

Not sure of module cut off point. I guess here where they list services.

### Azure Network Services

+ Az virtual netwoek
+ Az Load balancer
+ VPN Gateway
+ Az Application Gateway + firewall
+ CDN
+ Peering - connect virtual networks together in Az. vnet1 peer to vnet2. No encryption.
+ VNET peering - has additional security. Most peeeps do not need this. Goverments do.

Connect on-prem to Az

+ point to site - vpn client to az virtual network. public internet but encrypted.
+ site to site vpn - az is a branch off the office network. public internet but encrypted.
+ express route - private connection to Az and oFfice. Dedicated (physical) line. Expensive!

### Data

+ structured  - relation dbs
+ semi-structured no-sql. Cosmos.
+ unstructured - blob: pdfs, videos, emails

### Storage

exam tip: SMB `machine\\folder` format for accessing files.

+ Locally Redundant storage (LRS):
+ Zone ZRS:
+ Geo GRS, RA-GRS:

Globally unique storage account names as used as publuc urls.

### Az DB services

+ Cosmos - Global
+ Azure SQL - PaaS (don't have to have a VM with SQL on top)
+ Az Database Migration (on-prem to db services)

Marketplace - connects end users with solutions from MD, ISVs

### IoT

+ IoT central - basic service
+ IoT hub - bi-directional with the devices

### Big Data (was Data warehouse, now Azure Synapse Analytics)

+ Azure Synapse Analytics
+ HD Insight
+ Az Data Lake Analytics

SQL just runs through all the rows to produce a result - with massive data that's too slow.

### AI / Machine Learning

+ AZ ML service (for data scientists)
+ AZ Machine Learning Studio (for normal users). no code.

### Serverless

+ Functions: event triggered - 1 event in, 1 event out
+ Az logic Apps: need to make decision. Workflows
+ Event Grid: single point in, multiple things happen through routeing? (triggers multiple events)

### Dev Ops Service (was VSTS)

Collaborate on code.

+ pipelines
+ git repo
+ kanbab board
+ load test

Az Dev Labs
Quicj create at lower cost, locally.

Azure App Service (PaaS web apps, APIs etc)

### Management Tools

ARM Azure Resource Manager. Templates

+ Portal
+ Az PowerShell - Learn for exam. `get-command` will be in test. `get-help update-azvm` = commandlets verb-action.
+ Az CLI - begins with `az` command. Learn for exam - not as full featured (yet) as PS.
+ Az Cloud Shell - in portal it's the PowerShell icon: brings up a shell. `> az` brings up help. eg: `> az group create --help`
+ Az (Mobile) App

Learn these for repeatability. PS and CLI.

In exam tasks they don't care if it's portal or PS as long as you get it down.

## Examine Microsoft Azure security, privacy, compliance, and trust (AZ-900)
